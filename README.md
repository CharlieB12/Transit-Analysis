# Transit-Analysis
Final Project for GEOG 5223.

What the program does so far:

Creates a widget on QGIS that allows for the selection of points. With these points, the user can enter a buffer radius, in miles, to be applied to the points. When the button to apply the buffer is pressed, a new shapefile is created named "Buffer"
  
  **Whenever working with this tool, the point layer should be the active layer, otherwise points will not be selected when clicked on**
